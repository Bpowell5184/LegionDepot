Vision: Create a Inventory Management Application that can be used to manage a user's Star Wars Legion supply
1. As a collector, I want an easy way to add the units I've purchased to easily manage my inventory.
2. As a seller, I want to be able to remove miniatures from my account that I don't own anymore.
3. As a collector, I want to keep track of the myriad of multiple units I collect.
4. As a buyer, I want to be able to wishlist certain products so I can buy them in the future.
5. As a wargamer, I want to view what upgrade cards come in a unit box to build an effective tabletop list.
6. As a wargamer, I want to be able to search for specific cards in unit boxes I purchased to see if I own them already.
7. As a miniature painter, I want to be able to see example color schemes of units to get inspired.
8. As a wargamer, I want to be able to view the most popular competitive lists to build a powerful army.
9. As a collector, I want to be able to filter my invetory view to see different unit types and factions.
10. As a buyer, I want to see prices for units so I can create an accurate budget.
